    "The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "- `'r'`: Read mode. This is the default mode. It allows you to read the contents of the file.\n",
    "- `'w'`: Write mode. It truncates the file to zero length if it exists, or creates a new file for writing. It overwrites the existing contents of the file.\n",
    "- `'a'`: Append mode. It appends the data to the end of the file if it exists, or creates a new file for writing.\n",
    "- `'x'`: Exclusive creation mode. It creates a new file for writing, but raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "- `'b'`: Binary mode. It is used for binary files.\n",
    "- `'t'`: Text mode. It is used for text files. This is the default mode.\n",
